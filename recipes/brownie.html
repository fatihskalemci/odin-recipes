<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is the best brownie recipe I have tried so far. I took this recipe from
<a href="https://www.damyskitchen.com/2015/05/dunyanin-en-iyi-brownie-tarifi.html">Damy's Kitchen</a>
and made some changes according to my taste</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>290 gr bitter chocolate (broken to little pieces)</li>
    <li>90 gr butter</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>150 gr sugar</li>
    <li>1 tea spoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    <li>140 gr water</li>
    <li>A pack of white chocolate (broken as your preference)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your owen to 150 degree celsius.</li>
    <li>Take a 20x20cm square mold or heat resistant bowl and grease the bottom and sides of it
        with a little soft butter and put a greaseproof paper in it.
    </li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a proper saucepan, take it of the heat, add the chocolates and stir with
        a spatula until the chocolate melts. (Alternatively you can do this in the microwave by
        taken it out and mixing it once in a while). </li>
    <li>Beat eggs, sugar and vanilla in mixer bowl.</li>
    <li>Continue whisking by slowly pouring melted butter chocolate into it.</li>
    <li>Add the flour, salt and white chocolate as well and beat just until mixed.</li>
    <li>Pour the mixture into your square mold and bake in the oven for about 35 - 40 minutes. 
        (If the consistency you like in brownie is more runny, then you can reduce your cooking 
        time to 30 minutes.)</li>
    <li>Take it out and let it cool.</li>
</ol>
